# whiskywebshop

This whisky webshop is part of the CodeGorilla bootcamp "web developer".
We are doing this project to learn to do a project together following the Scrum method.

This webshop is especially designed as a online platform where whisky-dealers can meet their customers, promote and sell their whiskeys.
